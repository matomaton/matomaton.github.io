        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p class="no-marg">
            As the lead designer, I spearheaded the entire design journey for a new product, starting from its initial conception and carrying it through to its official launch. Our process kicked off with a design sprint dedicated to generating and validating concepts through user testing. Once we had a validated direction, I took charge of creating a functional prototype, which we then introduced to early adopters. This allowed us to assess core usability, publishing workflows, and feature sets within a limited release. We actively collected extensive user feedback during the early adopter phase, which played a pivotal role in shaping our product roadmap and guiding future feature development. This early engagement also helped generate interest in anticipation of the full product launch. It allowed me to distill the key elements of a successful MVP, enabling me to make informed judgments and negotiations regarding what constitutes a viable product.

    <p>Libraries and cultural institutions with primary source materials want to publish to JSTOR Shared Collections for wider reach, engagement, and impact in the scholarly community. But many institutions lack the time and resources to manually import and publish their existing collections onto a new platform. They need a simple and intuitive method to transfer their data onto JSTOR and manage their presence.
    </p>
    <h2>Design Sprint</h2>
    <p>To kick off a new product concept, I led a modified 3-day design sprint with our core product team of one Product Manager, a Product Designer (myself), a UX Researcher, and four engineers. We consulted relevant experts like a Metadata Librarian, Data Governance Director, Product Marketing Director and VP of Open Collections to inform our direction. This abridged sprint focused on problem definition and solution ideation. We identified key risks, focus areas, design principles and created numerous concept sketches. Synthesizing the sprint outputs provided me a strong foundation to start developing an initial concept to validate with users.</p>

    <h2>Concept Testing</h2>
    <p>We began with low fidelity screen designs to encourage candid feedback and open the door for significant suggestions. This approach prevented participants from assuming the designs were final. After validating our assumptions and refining our direction with initial feedback, we used our design system, Pharos, to rapidly create a complete workflow prototype for end-to-end publishing testing.

    </figure>
    </div>
    <p>One of the crucial pieces of the concept test was the marketing email.  I wrote the copy with input from a marketing representative.  I also designed the layout and the content to provide a realistic preview of what our new product would produce.  We showed the user the end product instead of the product itself since that is what we were getting feedback on.  I curated a few collections to include in the ‘concept’ email and iterated on the types of collections we highlighted.  We received feedback from users that they were not sure if their content was appropriate, so I made changes to show a breadth of examples so that each participant could see their collections as part of JSTOR.  We even asked if using the product before committing would be of value such as a sandbox feature.  We were able to gather quite a bit of information from just one screen.

    <h3>The Starting Point</h3>

        <figcaption>Metadata/Media Focus</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </div>
    <p>we needed to understand how potential users wanted to begin using the Collection Loader. Would they prefer starting from the overall structure and themes, or focus instead on the media objects and metadata? To find out, we showed side-by-side options that represented each approach. This comparative format sparked a valuable dialogue about the merits of each and gave us tangible insights into real user preferences. Ultimately, the side-by-side comparative approach was a big win - it enabled us to tease out user needs and make more informed design decisions.

    <h3>User Control</h3>

</div>
<p>Mapping metadats is arguably one of the most important steps in the publishing process. The system is showing how it interprets the metadata from the user and allows them to make changes.</p>
<p>Another crucial step in the process is to set up how the collection will be presented to scholars.  Here we explorers what types of tools and context they would like to provide a scholar when visiting their collection
</p>
<p>The concept test gave us the confidence we needed to start investing in building something.  Next we wanted to test a beta with real metadata from users to get a more realistic view of how valuable users would find the product.
</p>
<h2>Early Adopter Program</h2>
<p>The Collection Loader Early Adopter Program was broken up into 2 phases. 
   <ul class="ul-space"><li>Phase 1 - the “overview session” where participants met with the team to get an introduction of the Collection Loader, answer any questions, and discuss trialing the tool</li>
    <li>hase 2  - the actual hands-on trial of Collection Loader where participants loaded and published a collection to JSTOR</li></ul>
    </p>
<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>Test usability, and gauge interest in the adoption of the tool
    </p>
<h3>Participants</h3>
<p>Twenty five institutions in total participated in Collection Loader overview sessions, while fifteen institutions trialed the Collection Loader tool
    </p>
<h3>Findings</h3>
<p>Despite—and because—the Collection Loader tool being in development throughout this program, participants provided valuable insights that informed product and development priorities. 
</p>
<ul class="ul-space"><li>Aligned the product design closer to the needs of the user</li>
   <li>Pinpointed critical pre-launch issues for resolution</li>
    <li>Validated workflow, design, and opportunities for improvement</li>
    <li>Created an FAQ to equip the support and onboarding teams</li></ul>
    <blockquote>“This process is amazing for us. I used to use CONTENTdm and would set it up to upload overnight. I could do the same [with Collection Loader]— load it at the end of day. This works for us! Donors complain: Why isn’t it up? And here I have control.”

    <figcaption>Contextual Assistance</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>For first-time publishers, we aimed to guide them through the journey of publishing on our platform. The documentation includes diagrams and step-by-step details for each stage of the publishing process. It also contains links to more in-depth support articles on our external help site. I worked closely with the Support team to create an editorial workflow so we can collaborate effectively as the product evolves. This will allow us to keep the publishing documentation up-to-date and provide new users with the assistance they need for a smooth onboarding experience.  Additioanlly we included contexutal assistance at each step so users did not have to exit the flow to understand what to do and give them the convidence to continue.</p>

    <figcaption>Automation and Autonomy</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>What distinguishes this product from similar ones is that it automatically maps metadata fields from the user's content to corresponding fields in the JSTOR platform. This maximizes discoverability by integrating with JSTOR's search, filtering, and sorting tools. At the same time, we empower users by allowing them to review the automated mappings, edit them if needed, and opt out if they prefer to manually configure the field mapping. The key differentiation is the combination of automatic metadata mapping for platform integration while still giving users control over how their content is interpreted and presented. This sets us apart by providing both automation for ease of use and autonomy for flexibility - factors that matter greatly to our users.</p>
<h2>Visability of System Status</h2>

<p>Building trust with our content contributors was crucial so they would feel confident in our ability to be good stewards of their valuable artifacts. To establish trust, we focused on keeping users aware of the ingestion process through timely status updates and easy access to that information. Our goal was to continually inform users where their content is in the workflow, surface any issues quickly, provide ways to fix them, and make status highly visible. By providing transparency into the ingestion process, we aim to demonstrate our capability and care when bringing new materials into the platform. This approach shows contributors we are committed to safeguarding their objects while keeping them looped in each step of the way.</p>
